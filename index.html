    <h1>How to Choose the Perfect Durian: The King of Fruits</h1>
    
    <p>Durian, known as the "King of Fruits," is a tropical delicacy loved by many for its rich, creamy texture and complex flavor profile. However, choosing a good durian can be challenging for beginners. Follow this guide to select the perfect durian every time.</p>
    
    <img src="https://example.com/durian-varieties.jpg" alt="Different types of durians" title="Various durian varieties">
    
    <h2>1. Examine the Shape</h2>
    <p>Look for durians with a symmetrical, oval shape. This indicates even development of the fruit's segments (locules) inside:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rounder durians</strong> tend to have more flesh</li>
        <li><strong>Elongated durians</strong> often have fewer but larger segments</li>
        <li>Avoid irregular shapes as they may indicate uneven ripening</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="tip-box">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The bottom (calyx end) should be slightly flat - this often indicates more developed flesh segments.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>2. Check the Stem</h2>
    <p>The stem reveals important information about freshness:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh stems are greenish and moist</li>
        <li>Older durians have dry, brown stems</li>
        <li>Thicker stems often indicate the tree was well-nourished</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Assess the Spikes</h2>
    <p>The spikes can tell you about the fruit's maturity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ripe durians have spikes that are slightly flexible when pressed</li>
        <li>The tips may turn brown when fully ripe</li>
        <li>Very hard spikes often indicate under-ripeness</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. The Shake Test</h2>
    <p>Gently shake the durian while holding it close to your ear:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You should hear slight movement of the flesh inside</li>
        <li>No sound may indicate under-ripe fruit</li>
        <li>Too much movement might mean over-ripeness</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Always wear gloves when handling durians - the spikes are sharp!</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>5. Smell the Fruit</h2>
    <p>The aroma is one of the best indicators:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sweet, complex aromas indicate good quality</li>
        <li>Strong alcoholic smells suggest over-fermentation</li>
        <li>No smell might mean it's not ripe yet</li>
    </ul>
